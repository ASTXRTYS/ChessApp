# Dev Report - 2024-10-20 14:30 EST

- Stopped paused clocks from accepting turn swaps, freeze state on victory, and emit exact remaining time straight from state (`modules/game/engine.js`).
- Routed the audio toggle through state actions so `audioEnabled` persists and the audio engine respects mute state before creating sources (`modules/ui/settings.js`, `modules/audio/engine.js`).
- Debounced scene loads when both state and events fire, preventing overlapping Three.js initialization (`modules/renderer/scene-manager.js`).
- Rebuilt the shell layout with accessible timer buttons, responsive glassmorphism styling, and palette-driven gradients (`index.html`, `assets/styles/app.css`, `modules/ui/shell.js`).
- Upgraded the settings drawer with active scene highlighting, filtered scene options, and polished controls (`modules/ui/settings.js`, `core/config.js`).
- Added narrated status updates for key events and improved modal accessibility (`modules/ui/shell.js`, `modules/ui/controls.js`).
- Brought the `zen` and `cyberpunk` scenes to life with bespoke lighting, geometry, and timer displays, plus global styling hooks (`modules/renderer/scenes/zen.js`, `modules/renderer/scenes/cyberpunk.js`, `assets/styles/app.css`).

Manual verification: toggled pause/victory flows, cycled Classic → Zen → Cyberpunk scenes, adjusted audio toggle, selected player palettes, and exercised keyboard controls.
