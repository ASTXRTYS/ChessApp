## Integration Architecture

### Event Flow

```
User clicks timer
    ↓
Game module emits: game:player-switched
    ↓
Particles module listens → createHitBurst()
    ↓
30 particles added to active array
    ↓
Renderer calls: updateParticles(deltaTime)
    ↓
Physics applied, particles animated
    ↓
Renderer calls: renderer.render(scene, camera)
    ↓
Particles visible on screen
```

### State Subscriptions

```javascript
subscribe('particlesEnabled', enabled => {
  // Enable/disable entire system
  setEnabled(enabled)
})
```

### Events Consumed

- `game:player-switched` → Hit burst at timer
- `game:victory` → Confetti explosion
- `renderer:scene-loaded` → Ambient particles (3D only)
- `game:reset` → Clear all particles

### Events Emitted

- `particles:initialized` → System ready
- `particles:burst-created` → Hit burst created
- `particles:confetti-created` → Confetti spawned
- `particles:ambient-created` → Ambient particles added

## Integration Verification

### Renderer Module Changes

**File**: `/modules/renderer/scene-manager.js`

**Changes Made**:
1. Line 12: Added particle system import
2. Line 55: Added `initParticles(scene)` call
3. Line 229: Added `updateParticles(deltaTime)` in render loop
4. Line 163: Already emits `renderer:scene-loaded` event

**Status**: ✅ Integration complete and verified

### How to Test Integration

1. Open `v2/index.html` in browser
2. Start a game (click Play)
3. Click a timer → See particle burst
4. Let timer run to 0 → See confetti
5. Switch to Stadium/Zen scene → See ambient particles
6. Check console for no errors
7. Verify 60fps maintained

---

## Known Limitations

These are intentional design decisions, not bugs:

1. **Timer Positions**: Hardcoded at y: ±3
   - Can be made dynamic if needed
   - Current values work well for all scenes

2. **Max Particles**: 1000 particle capacity
   - More than sufficient for current effects
   - Can be increased if needed (change MAX_PARTICLES)

3. **Ambient Boundaries**: Wrap at ±10 units
   - Works well for current scene sizes
   - Can be adjusted per scene if needed

4. **Single System**: One global particle system
   - Simpler architecture
   - Sufficient for current requirements

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Potential additions for future versions:

1. **Per-Scene Particle Themes**
   - Stadium: Spark particles
   - Zen: Cherry blossom petals
   - Cyberpunk: Glitch particles

2. **Impact Wave Rings**
   - Expanding ring on timer hit
   - Like ripples on water

3. **Score Number Particles**
   - Time remaining floats up
   - Achievement unlocks show XP

4. **Advanced Physics**
   - Particle collision detection
   - Attraction/repulsion forces
   - Wind simulation

5. **Particle Trails**
   - Motion blur effect
   - Already scaffolded in effects.js

---

## Performance Optimization Details

### Object Pooling Strategy

```javascript
// Pre-allocate buffers once
const positions = new Float32Array(1000 * 3)
const colors = new Float32Array(1000 * 3)
const sizes = new Float32Array(1000)
const alphas = new Float32Array(1000)

// Reuse particle slots
function getNextParticleIndex() {
  if (particles.length >= MAX_PARTICLES) return -1
  return nextParticleIndex++
}

// No per-frame allocations = no GC pressure
```

### Custom Shader Benefits

**Vertex Shader:**
- Size attenuation with distance (perspective)
- More efficient than PointsMaterial size property

**Fragment Shader:**
- Circular particle shape (disc instead of square)
- Soft alpha fade at edges (smooth)
- Discards pixels outside circle (performance)

### Update Loop Optimization

```javascript
// Backward iteration for safe removal
for (let i = particles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  // Update physics
  // Remove dead particles without shifting array
}

// Batch buffer updates (not per-particle)
geometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true
```

## API Reference Summary

### system.js Exports

```javascript
init(scene)              // Initialize with Three.js scene
update(deltaTime)        // Update particles (called by renderer)
setEnabled(enabled)      // Toggle particles on/off
clearAll()              // Remove all particles
getParticleCount()      // Get active particle count
isInitialized()         // Check if system is ready
```

### effects.js Exports

```javascript
createHitBurst(pos, color, particles, getIndex)
createConfetti(winner, particles, getIndex)
createAmbientParticles(particles, getIndex)
createStressParticles(player, particles, getIndex)    // Bonus
createEnergyBurst(player, particles, getIndex)        // Bonus
createTrail(start, end, color, particles, getIndex)   // Future
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Particles Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Console shows `[Particles] Initialized successfully`
2. Console shows `[Particles] System created with 1000 particle capacity`
3. No JavaScript errors in console
4. `particlesEnabled` state is true
5. Scene is 3D (not classic) for ambient particles

### Performance Issues

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce MAX_PARTICLES constant (line 24 in system.js)
2. Reduce particle counts in effects.js
3. Disable shadows in renderer
4. Lower screen resolution
5. Disable ambient particles

### Integration Issues

**Verify:**
1. Renderer calls `init(scene)` after scene creation
2. Renderer calls `update(deltaTime)` in animation loop
3. Scene-loaded event is emitted after scene loads
4. Game module emits player-switched and victory events

---

## Dependencies

**External:**
- Three.js r160 (CDN) - BufferGeometry, Points, ShaderMaterial

**Internal:**
- `core/events.js` - Event bus (emit, on)
- `core/state.js` - State management (subscribe, get)
- `core/config.js` - Configuration constants

**No other dependencies** - Fully self-contained module

---

## Browser Compatibility

**Tested On:**

- Edge 118+ ✓

**Requirements:**
