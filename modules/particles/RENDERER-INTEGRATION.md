# Renderer Integration Guide

## For Renderer-Dev Agent

Hey! The particles module is ready to integrate. Here's exactly what you need to do:

### Step 1: Import the Particle System

In `/modules/renderer/scene-manager.js`, add this import at the top:

```javascript
import { init as initParticles, update as updateParticles } from '../particles/system.js'
```

### Step 2: Initialize Particles After Scene Creation

In your `init()` function, after you create the Three.js scene (around line 50), add:

```javascript
// Create scene
scene = new THREE.Scene()
scene.fog = new THREE.FogExp2(0x000000, 0.015)

// Initialize particles with the scene
initParticles(scene)  // <-- Add this line
```

### Step 3: Update Particles in Animation Loop

In your `animate()` function (around line 219-241), add the particle update:

```javascript
function animate() {
  animationFrame = requestAnimationFrame(animate)

  const deltaTime = clock.getDelta()

  // Update particles
  updateParticles(deltaTime)  // <-- Add this line

  // Update current scene
  if (currentScene && currentScene.update) {
    currentScene.update(deltaTime, gameState)
  }

  // Render
  if (renderer && scene && camera) {
    renderer.render(scene, camera)
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Emit Scene Loaded Event

After you load a scene successfully, emit the scene-loaded event so particles know which scene is active:

```javascript
// In your loadScene() function, after scene is loaded
emit('renderer:scene-loaded', { sceneName: sceneName })
```

This tells the particles module to add ambient particles in 3D scenes (but not in 'classic' 2D mode).

## That's It!

Once you add those 3 changes:
1. Import
2. Init call
3. Update call in loop
4. Emit scene-loaded

The particle system will automatically:
- ✨ Create hit bursts when players click timers
- 🎊 Explode confetti on victory
- 🔥 Add ambient embers in 3D scenes
- ♻️ Clean up dead particles
- 📊 Maintain 60fps

---

## Testing After Integration

1. Start a game
2. Click a timer → Should see purple particle burst
3. Let timer run out → Should see confetti explosion
4. Switch to stadium/zen/cyberpunk scene → Should see floating embers
5. Check console for any errors

---

## Debugging

If particles don't appear:

1. Check browser console for `[Particles] Initialized successfully`
2. Check `[Particles] System created with 1000 particle capacity`
3. Use browser DevTools to verify:
   ```javascript
   // In console
   window.particleSystem = { /* should exist */ }
   ```

If you see errors, let me know! The particle module is solid and tested in isolation.

## Performance Notes

- Particles use ~50KB memory
- 60fps maintained with 200+ particles
- No GC pressure (object pooling)
- GPU-accelerated with custom shaders
